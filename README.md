httpclient is a simple convenience package for performing http/api requests in Go. It wraps the standard libraries net/http package to avoid the repetitive request->decode->closebody logic you're likely so familiar with. Using the lib is very simple - just as with the net/http package you can define a client of your own or use the default. Below is a very basic example.

### Usage

```go
package main

import "github.com/starboy/httpclient"

func main() {
	s, err := httpclient.GetString("https://api.github.com/users/starboy/repos")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	println(s)
}
```
